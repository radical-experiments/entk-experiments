    # duration and concurrency. This examples shows how to use the RA API to
    # performan duration analysis, using both states and events.

    # to the documentation of RADICAL-Pilot, we know that a pilot is active
    # between the state 'ACTIVE' and one of the three final states 'DONE',
    # 'CANCELED', 'FAILED' of all the entities of RP.
